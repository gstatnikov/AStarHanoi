### ðŸ§© Project Overview

This project implements an efficient **A\*** search algorithm to solve the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle for **any number of disks and pegs**.  
Unlike traditional recursive solutions, this implementation models the problem as a **graph search**, enabling **intelligent state exploration** through an **admissible heuristic**. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability, especially in more complex configurations.
